# Obsidian Custom Cursor

This is a simple plugin to add some customisability options to the typing cursor 'caret' in Obsidian, including a smooth typing animation.

Current customisability options include:
- Cursor colour (defaults to white or black depending on your theme).
- Cursor blink speed.
- Cursor blink delay (amount of time before the cursor starts blinking after being moved).
- The degree of smoothness in the cursor animation when typing. Can be disabled. 
- Cursor width.

Originally created as a response to [this thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/cursor-smooth-caret-animation/31068) regarding a smooth cursor animation when typing in the Obsidian editor. However, I would like to expand it to provide more general cursor customisability options in the future.

The custom cursor caret using the class name `custom-cursor` so it may be possible to further customise it using css.

## Installation
Hopefully this plugin will be available to download directly from Obsidian shortly (`Settings -> Community plugins -> Browse -> 'Custom Cursor' in search`). 

In the meantime, the plugin can be enabled by first downloaing the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin from the link or Obsidian Community plugins, and adding the link to this github repository (`Options -> Add Beta plugin -> copy url`). 

## Issues, features and contributions
This is my first Obsidian plugin so there will inevitably be issues - pleas report any bugs and/or feature requests for further customisability options and I'll do my best to update the plugin!

There is currently no documentation for contributing but the plugin is very small so feel free to make changes yourself and submit a pull request.
